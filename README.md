# PotentialCustomersPrediction
This project involves identifying which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers based on attributes of leads and their interaction details.

Course Project Learnings and Achievements: This project provided a valuable opportunity to apply and deepen the skills learned throughout the course. My journey involved: Applying Machine Learning Techniques: Building and evaluating Decision Tree and Random Forest models to solve a real-world business problem. This reinforced my understanding of classification algorithms, model training, and performance evaluation metrics like precision and recall. Mastering Data Analysis and Visualization: Utilizing libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for comprehensive EDA, uncovering key insights into lead behavior and conversion drivers. This enhanced my ability to extract meaningful patterns from data. Practicing Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding and splitting data for modeling solidified my data preparation skills, crucial for building robust models. Understanding Model Interpretation: Analyzing feature importance for both Decision Tree and Random Forest models allowed me to understand which factors are most influential in predicting lead conversion, providing actionable insights for the business. The visualization of the tuned Decision Tree further enhanced my ability to interpret model decisions. Hyperparameter Tuning: Implementing GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters demonstrated how to optimize model performance and address issues like overfitting, leading to a more generalized and reliable model. Translating Analysis to Recommendations: The project culminated in translating the technical findings into clear, actionable recommendations for ExtraaLearn, highlighting the importance of communicating complex results to stakeholders. Key Achievements: Successfully built predictive models with a high recall score (85%) for identifying potential converted leads, directly addressing the business objective of minimizing missed opportunities. Identified and validated the most impactful factors driving lead conversion (time on website, first interaction channel, profile completion, occupation, and referrals) through consistent findings across different models. Developed a clear profile of an ideal lead, providing a target audience for optimized marketing and sales strategies. Provided specific, data-driven recommendations that ExtraaLearn can implement to improve lead conversion rates and resource allocation. This project has significantly boosted my confidence in applying data science techniques to solve business problems and has been a valuable learning experience in the course.
